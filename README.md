# Requirements

These are build rules for [bazel][bazel-home].  If you have not already
installed `bazel` on your workstation, follow the
[bazel instructions][bazel-install].  Here's one way (osx):


> Note about protoc and related tools: bazel and rules_protobuf will
> download or build-from-source all required dependencies, including
> the `protoc` tool and required plugins.  If you do already have
> these tools installed, bazel will not use them.

```sh
$ curl -O -J -L https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/0.3.1/bazel-0.3.1-installer-darwin-x86_64.sh
$ shasum -a256 bazel-0.3.1-installer-darwin-x86_64.sh
8d035de9c137bde4f709e3666271af01d1ef6bed6921e1a676d6a6dc0186395c  bazel-0.3.1-installer-darwin-x86_64.sh
$ chmod +x bazel-0.3.1-installer-darwin-x86_64.sh
$ ./bazel-0.3.1-installer-darwin-x86_64.sh
$ bazel version
Build label: 0.3.1
...
```

> Note about golang: this project uses [rules-go][rules_go] for
> `go_library`, `go_binary`, and `go_test`.

# Quick Start

Require these rules your `WORKSPACE`:

```python
git_repository(
  name = "org_pubref_rules_protobuf",
  remote = "https://github.com/pubref/rules_protobuf",
  tag = "v0.5.0",
)
```

 Trigger loading of external dependencies.  Specify the language(s)
you'd like support for.


```python
load("@org_pubref_rules_protobuf//bzl:rules.bzl", "protobuf_repositories")
protobuf_repositories(
   with_go = True,
   with_java = True,
   with_cpp = True,
)
```

> Note: refer to the [bzl/repositories.bzl][repositories.bzl] file for
> the set of external dependencies that will be loaded into your
> project.

Build a java-based gRPC library:

```python
load("@org_pubref_rules_protobuf//bzl:java/rules.bzl", "java_proto_library")

java_proto_library(
  name = "protolib",
  protos = ["my.proto"],
  with_grpc = True,
  verbose = 1, # 0=no output, 1=show protoc command, 2+ more...
)
```

# Examples

To run the examples & tests in this repository, clone it to your
workstation.

```sh
# Clone this repo
$ git clone https://github.com/pubref/rules_protobuf

# Go to examples/helloworld directory
$ cd rules_protobuf/examples/helloworld

# Run all tests
$ bazel test ...

# Build a server
$ bazel build cpp/server

# Run a server from the command-line
$ $(bazel info bazel-bin)/examples/helloworld/cpp/server

# Run a client
$ bazel run go/client
$ bazel run cpp/client
$ bazel run java/org/pubref/rules_closure/examples/helloworld/client:netty
```


# Overriding Dependencies

To load alternate versions of dependencies, pass in a `dict` having
the same overall structure of the [repositories.bzl][repositories.bzl]
file.  Entries having a matching key will override those found in the
file.  For example, to load a different version of
https://github.com/golang/protobuf, provide a different commit ID:

```
load("@org_pubref_rules_protobuf//bzl:rules.bzl", "protobuf_repositories")
protobuf_repositories(
   with_go = True,
   overrides = {
     "com_github_golang_protobuf": {
       "commit": "2c1988e8c18d14b142c0b472624f71647cf39adb", # Aug 8, 2016
     }
   },
)
```

# Proto B --> Proto A dependencies

Use the `proto_deps` attribute to name proto rule dependencies. The
implementation of the dependent rule `B` should match that of the
dependee `A`.  This relationship is shown in the examples folder of
this repo.  Use of `proto_deps` implies you're using imports, so read
on...

## Imports

In all cases, these rules will include a `--proto_path=.` argument.
This is functionally equivalent to `--proto_path=$(bazel info
execution_root)`.  Therefore, when the protoc tool is invoked, it will
'see' whatever directory struture exists at the bazel execution root
for your workspace.  To better learn what this looks like, `cd $(bazel
info execution_root)` and look around.  In general, it contains all
your sourcefiles as they appear in your workspace, with an additional
`external/WORKSPACE_NAME` directory for all dependencies used.

This has implications for import statements in your protobuf
sourcefiles, if you use them.  The two cases to consider are imports
*within* your workspace (referred to here as *'internal' imports*), and
imports of other protobuf files in an external workspace (*external imports*).

### Internal Imports

Internal imports should require no additional parameters if your
import statements follow the directory structure of your workspace.
For example, the `examples/helloworld/proto/helloworld.proto` file
imports the `examples/proto/common.proto` file.  Since this follows
the same directory structure as the workspace, `protoc` can find it,
and no additional arguments to a `cc_proto_library` are required for
protoc tool.

*However*, the `cc_proto_library` rule in
`examples/helloworld/proto/BUILD:cpp` names the
`//examples/proto:cpp`'s `cc_proto_library` rule as a dependency in
order to (1) trigger generation of the `common.pb.{h,cc}` files AND
(2) include those generated files in the `cc_library` rule for
compiling the object files.

Additional `--proto_path` (`-I`) arguments can be supplied via the
`imports = []` attribute common to all rules if needed.

### External Imports

The same logic applied to external imports.  The two questions to
answer are:

1. *Can protoc "see" the imported file?* In order to satisfy this
   requirement, pass in the full path of the required file relative to
   your execution root.  For example, the the well-known descriptor
   proto could be made visible to protoc via something like...

```python
java_proto_library(
  name = 'fooprotos',
  protos = 'foo.proto`,
  imports = [
    "external/com_github_google_protobuf/src/",
  ],
)
```

...if imported as `import "google/protobuf/descriptor.proto"` given
that the file
`@com_github_google_protobuf/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto` is
in the package `google.protobuf`.

2. *Can the `cc_proto_library` rule "see" the generated protobuf
   files* (in this case `descriptor.pb.{h,cc}`.  Just because the file
   was imported does not imply that protoc will generate outputs for
   it, so somewhere in the `cc_library` rule dependency chain these
   files must be present.  This could be via another
   `cc_proto_library` rule defined elswhere, or a some other filegroup
   or label list.  If the source is another `cc_proto_library` rule,
   specify that in the `proto_deps` attribute to the calling
   `cc_proto_library` rule.  Otherwise, pass a label that includes the
   (pregenerated) protobuf files to the `deps` attribute, just as you
   would any typical `cc_library` rule.Hopefully that made sense.
   It's tricky.
